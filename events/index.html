<p>Local Colors was involved in local shows, outdoor events, and the ongoing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sugarhouseartwalk/">Sugar House Art Walk</a>. Historically, it also hosted art classes and plein air events.</p>
<p>The gallery’s featured shows, which rotated monthly, would highlight the work of one its member artists—and, beginning in 2021, a guest artist as well. Featured artists were celebrated with a prominent front window display and an artist reception.</p>
