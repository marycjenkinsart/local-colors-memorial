## Events

Local Colors was involved in local shows, outdoor events, and the ongoing [Sugar House Art Walk](https://www.facebook.com/sugarhouseartwalk/). Historically, it also hosted art classes and plein air events.

The gallery's featured shows, which rotated monthly, would highlight the work of one its member artistsâ€”and, beginning in 2021, a guest artist as well. Featured artists were celebrated with a prominent front window display and an artist reception.
